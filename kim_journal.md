#This is my journal 

1. What did we do? 
--> We wrote the process that we need to eat bread as a group. We had to wrote really specifically. If teacher did all of the processes that we wrote and if he did what we meant, then we were able to eat bread.
2. Whay did you learn?
--> I learned that we have to be really specific if we make something or someone to do what we want because I saw that teacher was not doing as we meant. 
3. Question I have. 
--> Nothing!
